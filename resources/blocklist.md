# Blocklist

Phantom hosts a community-maintained repository of malicious websites that target Solana users. If a user navigates to a site that has been deemed malicious, Phantom will redirect them to the Phantom Blocklist Page and and warn them of any suspicious connection requests. The list of these malicious sites is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/phantom-labs/blocklist) and is open to [community contributions](https://github.com/phantom-labs/blocklist#contributing).
