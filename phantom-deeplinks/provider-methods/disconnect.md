# Disconnect

After an initial [Connect](connect.md) event has taken place, an app may disconnect from Phantom at anytime. Once disconnected, Phantom will reject all signature requests until another connection is established.

### Base URL

```
https://phantom.app/ul/v1/disconnect
```

### Query String Parameters

* `dapp_encryption_public_key` **(required)**: The original encryption public key used from the app side for an existing [Connect](connect.md) session.
* `nonce` **(required)**: A nonce used for encrypting the request, encoded in base58.
* `redirect_link` **(required)**: The URI where Phantom should redirect the user upon completion. Please review [Specifying Redirects](../specifying-redirects.md) for more details. URL-encoded.

        "session": "...", // token received from the connect method
    }
