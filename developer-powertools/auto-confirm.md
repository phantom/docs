{% embed url="https://youtu.be/WAfv06CPiRo" %}

[Auto-Confirm](https://phantom.app/learn/blog/auto-confirm) is a feature that lets users submit transactions and signed messages without triggering an approval dialog. When Auto-Confirm is enabled, Phantom will still analyze requests and their accompanying domains before signing.

This feature is currently in beta. If you would like to enable this your project, please let us know via our [Advanced Feature Interest Form](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/phantomfeatures).
