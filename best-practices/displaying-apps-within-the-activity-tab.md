# Displaying Apps within the Activity Tab

When a user views their historical activity, Phantom will parse their dApp interactions and enrich them with known metadata. The following are two examples of how Phantom displays historical transactions on [Magic Eden](https://magiceden.io/) and [Jupiter](https://jup.ag/), respectively:

To enable this, dApp developers can send an email to [developers@phantom.app](mailto:developers@phantom.app) with the following information:

1. URL of the Website
2. Display name of the dApp
3. Program/Contract IDs
4. Interaction names (corresponding to program IDs)
