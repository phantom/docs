# Displaying Tokens on Solana

If you've created a token on Solana using the [SPL Token Program](https://spl.solana.com/token) or [Token-2022 Program (i.e. "Token Extensions")](https://spl.solana.com/token-2022), then your token is compatible with Phantom. If Phantom users own a certain balance of a token made with these programs, that balance will always appear in their wallet. However, if Phantom cannot find more metadata about that token, it will display the token as "Unknown".

### Searching for Metadata

When searching for metadata, Phantom will first look to the [Token Metadata Program](https://docs.metaplex.com/programs/token-metadata/overview) established by [Metaplex](https://www.metaplex.com/). This program enhances ordinary SPL token [mints](https://docs.solana.com/integrations/exchange#token-mints) with a **Metadata Account** that describes additional fields such as the token's `symbol`, `image`, and `description`. Some of these fields exist on-chain in the Metadata Account itself, while others exist off-chain in a JSON file that follows a [standard format](https://docs.metaplex.com/programs/token-metadata/token-standard). The link to this off-chain JSON file is found at the Metadata Account's `uri` field.

If a Metadata Account is found, Phantom will prioritize on-chain fields (e.g. `name`, `symbol`) before off-chain fields described in the `uri` JSON file.

### Categorizing Tokens

Phantom will categorize and display tokens based on their [Token Standard](https://docs.metaplex.com/programs/token-metadata/token-standard#token-standards). The `tokenStandard` field can be found in the token's on-chain Metadata Account and is used to describe a token's fungibility. The `tokenStandard` field has four options:

* `Fungible`: A token with simple metadata that can be freely mixed with others of the same mint. Common examples include [USDC](https://www.circle.com/en/usdc) and [SRM](https://www.projectserum.com/).
* `FungibleAsset`: A token with metadata that can also have NFT-like attributes. Commonly referred to as Semi-Fungible, these tokens are often used in gaming contexts to support stackable items like a piece of wood.
* `NonFungible`: A non-fungible token with a [Master Edition](https://docs.metaplex.com/programs/token-metadata/accounts#master-edition) account. This is the most popular type of NFT, encompassing well known collections like [Solana Monkey Business](https://solanamonkey.business/) and [DeGods](https://www.degods.com/).
* `NonFungibleEdition`: A non-fungible token with an [Edition](https://docs.metaplex.com/programs/token-metadata/accounts#edition) account (printed from a Master Edition). This is a helpful feature for creators who want to offer multiple copies of their 1/1 NFTs.
* `ProgrammableNonFungible`: A new non-fungible asset class which allows for flexible configuration of various lifecycle rules triggered by specific actions. More info about Programmable NFTs or pNFTs can be found [here](https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex-program-library/blob/master/token-metadata/program/ProgrammableNFTGuide.md).

If no `tokenStandard` is set, Phantom will fallback to categorizing tokens based on the following logic:

1. If the total mint supply is 1, Phantom will consider the token to be `NonFungible`.
2. If the total mint supply is greater than 1 and the mint has 0 decimals, Phantom will consider the token to be a `FungibleAsset`.
3. Phantom will consider all other tokens to be `Fungible`.

### Displaying Tokens

Phantom will display all `Fungible` tokens in the Home tab. For more information on `Fungible` token best practices, please see:

[home-tab-fungibles.md](home-tab-fungibles.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

All other token standards (`FungibleAsset`, `NonFungible`, and `NonFungibleEdition`) will be displayed in the Collectibles tab. For more information on collectible best practices, please refer to:
