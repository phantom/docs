# Events

Phantom's provider API available at `window.ethereum` implements a Node.js style [`EventEmitter` ](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html)API, that allows you to hook into different events that are emitted upon certain actions that take place in either the dapp, or the wallet. Each page in this section will be an isolated piece of information that informs you of all the technical details you need to know about each event Phantom supports.
