# Properties

Here you will find a list of all of the properties available to you once the `window.phantom.ethereum` object has been injected.\
\
These are all exactly the same as the `window.ethereum` object. However, we recommend using the `window.phantom.ethereum` object to prevent namespace collisions.

```json
{
    chainId: HexString
    networkVersion: String
    selectedAddress: HexString
    _events: Object
    _eventsCount: Number
}
```
